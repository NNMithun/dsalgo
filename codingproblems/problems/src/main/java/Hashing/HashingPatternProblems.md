Hashing is a powerful technique used in computer science to efficiently retrieve, insert, or delete elements from a collection. It's particularly useful for solving various array-related problems, especially those involving frequency counting, pattern recognition, or finding pairs with specific properties. Here are several common problem patterns in arrays and how hashing can be applied to solve them:

### 1. **Frequency Counting**
- **Problem**: Count the frequency of each element in an array.
- **Hashing Approach**: Use a hash map where keys are array elements, and values are their frequencies.

### 2. **Finding Duplicates**
- **Problem**: Find duplicates in an array.
- **Hashing Approach**: Store elements in a hash set. If an element is already in the set, it's a duplicate.

### 3. **Finding Subarrays with Given Sum**
- **Problem**: Find subarrays in an array whose sum equals a given target.
- **Hashing Approach**: Use prefix sums. Store the cumulative sum up to each index in a hash map. If the difference between the current sum and the target sum exists in the hash map, a subarray with the target sum exists.

### 4. **Pair Sum**
- **Problem**: Find pairs in an array that sum up to a given target.
- **Hashing Approach**: Store elements in a hash set. For each element, check if the complement (target - current element) exists in the set.

### 5. **Anagrams**
- **Problem**: Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.
- **Hashing Approach**: Map each string to its sorted form. Anagrams will have the same sorted form, allowing you to group them easily.

### 6. **Zero Sum Subarray**
- **Problem**: Find subarrays in an array whose sum equals zero.
- **Hashing Approach**: Use prefix sums. Store the cumulative sum up to each index along with the index in a hash map. If the same sum is encountered again, there's a subarray with a zero sum.

### 7. **Longest Subarray with Equal Number of Zeros and Ones**
- **Problem**: Find the longest subarray with an equal number of zeros and ones.
- **Hashing Approach**: Replace zeros with -1. Calculate prefix sums. The longest subarray with equal zeros and ones will have the same prefix sum occurring twice.

### 8. **Distinct Elements**
- **Problem**: Count the number of distinct elements in an array.
- **Hashing Approach**: Use a hash set to store unique elements.

### 9. **Check for Subsequence**
- **Problem**: Given two arrays, check if the second array is a subsequence of the first.
- **Hashing Approach**: Store indices of elements in the first array using a hash map. Iterate through the second array and ensure elements are present in the map and in increasing indices.

### 10. **Sum of All Subarrays**
- **Problem**: Find the sum of all subarrays of an array.
- **Hashing Approach**: Sum of all subarrays can be calculated by summing each element with its frequency multiplied by the number of times it occurs on the left and right.

Hashing allows us to achieve efficient solutions for various array-related problems by trading space for time. It's particularly useful when dealing with frequency counting, pair finding, or pattern recognition tasks. When implementing hashing-based solutions, be mindful of collision handling and the choice of hashing function to maintain efficiency and correctness.
