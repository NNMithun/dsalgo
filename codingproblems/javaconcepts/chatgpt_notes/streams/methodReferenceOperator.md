In Java, the `::` operator is known as the method reference operator. It is used to refer to a method or a constructor without invoking it. Method references provide a shorthand notation for lambda expressions when the lambda expression is essentially calling another method.

There are several types of method references:

1. **Reference to a Static Method:**
   ```java
   ClassName::staticMethodName
   ```

2. **Reference to an Instance Method of a Particular Object:**
   ```java
   instance::instanceMethodName
   ```

3. **Reference to an Instance Method of an Arbitrary Object of a Particular Type:**
   ```java
   ClassName::instanceMethodName
   ```

4. **Reference to a Constructor:**
   ```java
   ClassName::new
   ```

Here's a simple example using the `::` operator:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MethodReferenceExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using lambda expression
        Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).forEach(x -> System.out.println(x));

        // Using method reference
        Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

In the above example, `System.out::println` is a method reference to the `println` method of the `PrintStream` class. It is equivalent to the lambda expression `x -> System.out.println(x)`.

Method references can make code more concise and readable, especially when you are calling a method that matches the signature of the functional interface. They are often used with functional interfaces, such as those used in the context of Java streams, where concise syntax is beneficial.
