It seems like you're asking about intermediate operations in Java Streams. In Java, Streams provide a powerful and expressive way to process collections of data. Intermediate operations are those operations that transform a Stream into another Stream. They are lazy, meaning they do not execute until a terminal operation is invoked on the Stream. Here are some common intermediate operations along with examples:

1. **filter(Predicate<T> predicate):**
   - Filters the elements of the Stream based on the given predicate.
   ```java
   List<String> words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi");
   Stream<String> filteredStream = words.stream().filter(word -> word.length() > 5);
   ```

2. **map(Function<T, R> mapper):**
   - Transforms each element of the Stream using the provided function.
   ```java
   List<String> words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi");
   Stream<Integer> lengths = words.stream().map(String::length);
   ```

3. **flatMap(Function<T, Stream<R>> mapper):**
   - Similar to `map`, but flattens the resulting streams into a single stream.
   ```java
   List<List<Integer>> numbers = Arrays.asList(Arrays.asList(1, 2), Arrays.asList(3, 4), Arrays.asList(5, 6));
   Stream<Integer> flattened = numbers.stream().flatMap(List::stream);
   ```

4. **distinct():**
   - Returns a stream consisting of distinct elements.
   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5);
   Stream<Integer> distinctNumbers = numbers.stream().distinct();
   ```

5. **sorted():**
   - Sorts the elements of the Stream in natural order.
   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5);
   Stream<Integer> sortedNumbers = numbers.stream().sorted();
   ```

6. **peek(Consumer<T> action):**
   - Returns a Stream consisting of the elements of the original Stream, additionally performing the provided action on each element.
   ```java
   List<String> words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi");
   Stream<String> peekedStream = words.stream().peek(word -> System.out.println("Processing: " + word));
   ```

7. **limit(long maxSize):**
   - Returns a Stream truncated to be no longer than the specified size.
   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);
   Stream<Integer> limitedNumbers = numbers.stream().limit(5);
   ```

8. **skip(long n):**
   - Returns a Stream with the first n elements removed.
   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);
   Stream<Integer> skippedNumbers = numbers.stream().skip(5);
   ```

These intermediate operations can be combined to perform complex data transformations and manipulations in a declarative and concise manner. Remember that these operations are lazy, and they do not produce any results until a terminal operation is applied to the Stream.
