The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the subject or the observable) changes its state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is commonly used to implement distributed event handling systems, where changes in one object need to be reflected in other objects without them being tightly coupled.

In Java, the Observer Pattern is typically implemented using the `java.util.Observer` interface and the `java.util.Observable` class, although it's important to note that as of Java 9, these classes are deprecated. Nonetheless, understanding their usage can provide insights into the pattern's implementation.

Here's an explanation of the key components in the Observer Pattern in Java:

1. **Subject (Observable)**:
    - The subject is the object being observed. It maintains a list of observers and provides methods to add, remove, and notify observers of any changes in its state.
    - In Java, the `Observable` class represents the subject. However, as mentioned earlier, it's deprecated in newer versions of Java. For the sake of illustration, let's assume we have a custom subject class `WeatherStation` that extends `Observable`.

```java
import java.util.Observable;

public class WeatherStation extends Observable {
    private int temperature;

    public void setTemperature(int temperature) {
        this.temperature = temperature;
        // Mark the object as changed
        setChanged();
        // Notify all observers about the change
        notifyObservers();
    }

    public int getTemperature() {
        return temperature;
    }
}
```

2. **Observer**:
    - The observer is the object that is interested in the state changes of the subject. It implements the `Observer` interface and provides an update method to receive notifications from the subject.
    - In Java, the `Observer` interface defines the `update` method, which observers must implement.

```java
import java.util.Observable;
import java.util.Observer;

public class WeatherObserver implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update(Observable o, Object arg) {
        if (o instanceof WeatherStation) {
            WeatherStation weatherStation = (WeatherStation) o;
            int temperature = weatherStation.getTemperature();
            System.out.println("Temperature updated: " + temperature);
            // Additional logic can be implemented here based on the state change
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Usage**:
    - Clients create instances of the subject (`WeatherStation`) and observers (`WeatherObserver`), register observers with the subject, and update the state of the subject as needed. Observers are automatically notified when the subject's state changes.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeatherStation weatherStation = new WeatherStation();
        WeatherObserver observer = new WeatherObserver();

        // Register observer with the subject
        weatherStation.addObserver(observer);

        // Simulate temperature change
        weatherStation.setTemperature(25);
    }
}
```

In this example, when the temperature of the `WeatherStation` object is changed using the `setTemperature` method, it notifies all registered observers about the change. The `update` method of each observer is then called, allowing them to react accordingly to the new temperature.
