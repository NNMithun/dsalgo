The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows a client to choose the algorithm it needs at runtime without tightly coupling the client to the chosen algorithm. This pattern promotes the principle of "composition over inheritance" by favoring composition (using objects that implement a certain behavior) over inheritance (subclasses with different behaviors).

Here's how the Strategy Pattern works:

1. **Strategy Interface**: Defines a common interface or abstract class for all supported algorithms. This interface typically declares one or more methods that encapsulate the algorithm's behavior.

2. **Concrete Strategies**: Concrete classes that implement the strategy interface. Each concrete strategy encapsulates a specific algorithm.

3. **Context**: The context is the object that needs to perform a task or execute an algorithm. It holds a reference to a strategy object and delegates the task to the strategy.

Let's illustrate this pattern with a simple example in Java:

```java
// Step 1: Strategy Interface
interface SortStrategy {
    void sort(int[] array);
}

// Step 2: Concrete Strategies
class BubbleSort implements SortStrategy {
    @Override
    public void sort(int[] array) {
        System.out.println("Sorting array using Bubble Sort");
        // Implementation of Bubble Sort algorithm
    }
}

class QuickSort implements SortStrategy {
    @Override
    public void sort(int[] array) {
        System.out.println("Sorting array using Quick Sort");
        // Implementation of Quick Sort algorithm
    }
}

// Step 3: Context
class ArrayContext {
    private SortStrategy strategy;

    public void setStrategy(SortStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void performSort(int[] array) {
        strategy.sort(array);
    }
}

// Example usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {5, 2, 7, 1, 3};
        
        // Create context
        ArrayContext context = new ArrayContext();
        
        // Use BubbleSort strategy
        context.setStrategy(new BubbleSort());
        context.performSort(array);
        
        // Use QuickSort strategy
        context.setStrategy(new QuickSort());
        context.performSort(array);
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `SortStrategy` is the strategy interface.
- `BubbleSort` and `QuickSort` are concrete strategies implementing different sorting algorithms.
- `ArrayContext` is the context that holds a reference to the current strategy and delegates sorting to it.

By changing the strategy at runtime using the `setStrategy` method, the context can switch between different sorting algorithms without modifying its code. This demonstrates the flexibility and interchangeability provided by the Strategy Pattern.
